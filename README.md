I made developer game with React and tachyons for the UI.
**The most difficult part was**  isolated the components and know how to do the on click event

Today I learned about Linters, in this case I used ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

If you want to use it in your project. You can do it using npm

```
npm install -g eslint
eslint --init
```

**The most difficult part was** fix all the linter's suggestions(were like 50 suggestions)

Also, I added a new feature to have Levels in the Dev Game, in order to do this, I had to create a Class called Level and create instance of this Class. I am going to improve this feature tomorrow with some validations and more levels.
