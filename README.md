Today I learned about Linters, in this case I used ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

If you want to use it in your project. You can do it using npm

```
npm install -g eslint
eslint --init
```

**The most difficult part was** fix all the linter's suggestions(were like 50 suggestions)
